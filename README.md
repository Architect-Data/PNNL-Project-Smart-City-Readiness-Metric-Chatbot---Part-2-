# Smart-City-Readiness-Metric-Chatbot---Part-2-
This is a continuation of Smart City Readiness Metric project. As part of the effort to create resiliency for cities, I created a chatbot using a pre-made model that answer information on resilience. We've fed information about resiliency strategy reports from Rockefeller Foundation and 100 RC Campaign, able to answer questions on resiliency.

The Chatbot is a beta model made within two months in my term during the work with PNNL. It uses Haystack and Roberta Model as a basis from the Hugging Face repository. It is computational heavy and takes longer at the current moment to answer for questions.
